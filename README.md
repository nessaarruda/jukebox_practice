# Jukebox Practice Repo

This is a copy of the in-class code-along project called Jukebox.

In this repo you'll find several branches where certain aspects of code are
missing. This provides you with an opportunity to practice building those bits
of functionality.

For example, a branch called "no-routing" may exist where `config/routes.rb`
file is present but empty. You must successfully build the routes necessary to
make your tests pass.

Another example, a branch called "no-model-tests" may exist where your feature
test coverage may be close to 100% but running `rspec spec/models/` tells you
that none of your model methods have unit testing or relationship/validation
testing, etc..

This readme will not exhaustively list all branches available, but the branch
names and failing tests should be descriptive enough to point you in the right
direction. In some cases, this README file will be updated with clues about
what is missing, but you will need to find the resources yourself to correct
the problems presented.
